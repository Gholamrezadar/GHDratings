# GHD Ratings
A Feature-rich episode ratings browser web-app targeting Naruto & Naruto Shippuden.


Similar websites like [tvcharts](https://tvcharts.co/show/naruto-tt0409591) struggle with long-running shows like Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, which have a large number of episodes and multiple story arcs. This project aims to provide a much better experience browsing episode ratings for these shows.
